# 🌟 **Hall of Fame** 🎉  

Welcome to the **Populix Hall of Fame** repository! This is where we celebrate the champions of code, the warriors of commits, and the heroes of pull requests. Whether you're a superstar or an underdog, you’ve earned your spot here! 🚀

## 🗳️ **How We Vote the Winners**  

It’s simple! The **"Panitia Penyelenggara"** (aka the voting committee) holds the power, and here's how we pick the champions:  

1. **It’s Up to Us, The "Panitia Penyelenggara"**  
   - We make the final call. No arguments, no complaints—our decisions are *final*... unless you bribe us with coffee. ☕  

2. **Nomination Ranting**  
   - If you're out here ranting about why someone else *shouldn't* win, guess what? That’s an automatic nomination for you! 😏

3. **Commit Counts**  
   - We’ll gather total commits from [Git Wrapped](https://git-wrapped.com/) or [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io/github-recap), and the more, the merrier! 📈  

4. **Meme Mastery**  
   - The one who shares memes most frequently (and funniest) wins extra points. Gotta keep the humor flowing! 😂  

5. **Bribes**  
   - Want to win? Try bribing us with something *really* good. Pizza, coffee, or even a new tech gadget might just tilt the scales in your favor. 🍕💰  

---

**🎉 So, remember: It’s not just about commits. It’s about making us laugh, keeping us awake, and sometimes even winning us over with a tasty bribe. Happy coding, and may the best meme-maker (and commit-pusher) win!**
